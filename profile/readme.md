## Introduction

Welcome to TermSurf's page, focusing on a few main things:

1. **software**: Open source software experimentation is the passion project.
1. **knowledge**: Understanding how the universe works and modeling information is the main drive.
1. **language**: Modeling things in natural language or code gives a deeper sense of reality.
1. **story**: Sharing learnings in the form of stories or philosophical conversations.

TermSurf is basically trying to synthesize and simplify the knowledge of the world so it boils down to something you could hold in your hand. Something where you can have a wide and at the same time deep sense of how the universe works.

TermSurf is creating a next generation data modeling framework, and APIs for the emerging group of digital natives coming into the work world full force. It's the hope that the designs and blueprints outlined in detail here will be implemented in the coming years. With all your help, and the help of AI in the time ahead, we will bring these interfaces to life, and they will make it super clean and straightforward to define patterns, structure data, and write reusable, shareable code.

As such, here a few sites to share what's been come up with so far, even though it is far far from being "finished". Each of these projects are very much a work in progress, most of them are just in the creative design phase, with some basic development underway.

## Open Source Software

The main passion project is to have one programming language or tool to build all possibilities of software apps and libraries. Something like [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), where everything is streamlined and out of the way so you can focus on your main task instead of wrangling code. Combined with something like [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) or [Dart](https://dart.dev/) where it compiles down to every platform natively. We are deep into the programming and computer science worlds, having been working toward this goal for several years. There's still a huge amount of work that remains to be done, and like mentioned earlier, the look and feel of everything is still being defined at this point, only barely scratching the surface in terms of making the code run.

There is [`note`](https://github.com/termsurf/note), a super minimal tree-based data modeling language sort of like YAML/JSON/XML, which is in some ways more readable and concise than them. That project is basically finished. The spec is defined in that repo, and a primitive parser is implemented to convert link text into a tree. The next step is taking the link tree and compiling it into runnable code via [`base.note`](https://github.com/termsurf/base.note).

The **goal** here is to create a suite of tools to write code in one language, Link, and have it work cross-platform in an optimized way. This means compiling the NoteText into Swift for iOS/MacOS/etc., Rust for Linux server-side, Kotlin for Android, and JavaScript for Windows, the Browser, and Node.js. But many of the projects are written in such a way as to be language agnostic. That is, you can use the definitions, which are written in `note`, as you would any JSON object in your standard programming language.

Once we can nail down a prototype implementation that works in at least JavaScript (Node.js and Browser), and either Swift or Rust, then we will start publicizing the results and asking for help. But currently things are fluctuating constantly so it might be too much to bring it out in the open (even though it's publicly open source). If you'd like to help though, even now, that would be totally wonderful, please reach out.

The following table outlines the key projects and their overall purpose, so you can see how the pieces of the puzzle fit together. This is mostly a love for learning, a journey to understand the fundamentals of building an optimized compiler.

We are just beginning, so _much_ work is being done on the specifications, with only rough prototype implementations to test out the specifications. Once we finish the specifications and base implementations, it should be a usable cross-platform environment. Please reach out to use by opening an issue in any of the projects or finding us on Twitter if you'd like to discuss, exchange ideas, or in other ways join in the fun.

## Language Building

At first there was the [`tone`](https://tone.surf) script, a writing system like the ancient runes that can encode any language on Earth in a concise and readable way using simple glyphs you could either carve on a rock, make out of sticks, or draw with a pen. It is built around tones, the vowel and consonant sounds, and there are 36 base glyphs, with special markers for things like tone in Chinese, and other important features. It is instantiated into a TypeScript library so you can convert an ASCII representation into the format used by the main font, ToneEtch.

Then there was [`tune`](https://tune.surf), a language derived from imagining an ancient stone-tool making monkey culture of the past, and evolved it into a modern language capable of representing all of modern concepts and knowledge, such as naming species and places and everything you can imagine. That is very much an evolving work-in-progress. The goal here is to create a an intermediary framework for representing knowledge, for creating a way to conjure up "fantasy" words so we can name things which don't have names, to explore new concepts and ways of thinking.
