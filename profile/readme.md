## About

ClueSurf is a collection of projects about software, language, and the universe.
It's not necessarily an organization or team, just a place to group related work under one name.

The main goal is to explore how the universe works and share tools, languages, and ideas on it.
Building things to model reality and make knowledge easier to understand.

## Focus

Working on four themes:

1. **Software**: Open source tools and experiments.
2. **Knowledge**: Modeling how the universe fits together.
3. **Language**: Creating ways to express ideas.
4. **Story**: Sharing insights through writing.

Most projects aim to make complex ideas simple, beautiful, and useful.

## Sites

These are some of the final sites/projects:

Each tool's underlying motivation is simplifying information and computation for the general public.

## Software Projects

We want to build tools to create apps easily and clearly.
Like Rails, Haxe, or Dart, but more flexible and more beautiful.

Working on a core language called [**TreeCode**](https://github.com/cluesurf/tree).
It's like JSON or YAML, but simpler and more readable.
From TreeCode, we compile into native code using [**StarTree**](https://github.com/cluesurf/star.tree).

Here's the plan:

- Write once in TreeCode.
- Compile to JavaScript, Swift, Rust, and Kotlin.
- Use a shared library of types and patterns.

Starting with JavaScript and Node.js support.
More platforms will follow.

| Project | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [`tree`](https://github.com/cluesurf/tree) | TreeCode syntax and parser. |
| [`star.tree`](https://github.com/cluesurf/star.tree) | Reactive compiler for TreeCode. |
| [`bind.tree`](https://github.com/cluesurf/bind.tree) | Native types for each platform. |
| [`base.tree`](https://github.com/cluesurf/base.tree) | Shared standard types and data. |
| [`deck.tree`](https://github.com/cluesurf/deck.tree) | TreeCode package manager. |
| [`flow.tree`](https://github.com/cluesurf/flow.tree) | Code/data runtime environment. |
| [`link.tree`](https://github.com/cluesurf/link.tree) | Third-party API integrations. |
| [`code.tree`](https://github.com/cluesurf/code.tree) | Grammars for converting text/data. |
| [`form.tree`](https://github.com/cluesurf/form.tree) | Math and formal systems. |

These projects are still in early stages.
Specs are being defined and tested.

## Language Projects

[**Tone**](https://github.com/cluesurf/tone) is a writing system made from simple shapes.
It can be used for any spoken language.
You can write with a pen, stick, or stylus.
There are 36 base glyphs, plus tone markers.

A TypeScript library turns text into this format.
Made this into a font called ToneEtch.

[**Tune**](https://github.com/cluesurf/tune) is a made-up language for modeling thoughts.
It started from imagining how ancient people might have spoken.
It can be used to name new ideas and create stories.

It helps you think and describe things in new ways.
The goal is to make it a bridge between human thought and code.
