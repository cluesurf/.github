### Quick Overview

We are developing a suite of repositories for natural languages and programming languages.

For the programming language, `link`, and it's compiler, `base`, we are making a language that works across devices (similar to Dart/Flutter), which will give you a minimal API footprint. That is, you will be able to learn the least amount possible to have the most possible power and so the biggest impact with the least effort. But at the same time, you will have direct access to the native objects in their original form, so you can have maximum optimization potential and use the underlying architecture's standard paradigms when necessary (such as pointers in the server-side/rust-like environment, which don't exist in JavaScript/browsers). This is possible thanks to the ownership ideas from the Rust community and the like, "move semantics" allow this to work.
